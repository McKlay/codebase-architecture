# Codebase Architecture: Designing for Scale, Modularity, and Sanity

> *"A practical, developer-first handbook for structuring React + FastAPI projects—from AI MVPs to scalable platforms."*

**Live Site**: [https://mcklay.github.io/codebase-architecture/](https://mcklay.github.io/codebase-architecture/)  
Author: [Clay Mark Sarte](https://github.com/McKlay)  
Built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) | Covers [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) | AI-first ready

---

## What This Is

This is a book-style, structured guide for software engineers who care deeply about **folder structure, modularity, scalability, and architectural sanity**—especially in the age of AI-driven, full-stack applications. 

Whether you're:
- building your first AI-powered prototype,
- collaborating across teams,
- or refactoring a tangled monolith into scalable layers—

This guide walks you through real-world **patterns, decisions, trade-offs, and templates** used in React + FastAPI ecosystems.

## Table of Contents (Brief)

- `Part 1 – Foundations`  
  Why folder structure matters. How modularity and scalability impact collaboration and maintainability.  

- `Part 2 – Modularity`  
  Feature-first folder structures for React + FastAPI. Ideal for solo devs, MVPs, and isolated features.  

- `Part 3 – Scalability`  
  Layered architecture. Cross-team readiness. How to scale shared logic, services, and infrastructure.  

- `Part 4 – Hybrid & Advanced`  
  Combining modular and scalable structures. Monorepos, shared logic, refactor-safe migration paths.  

- `Part 5 – Case Studies & Templates`  
  Real-world AI apps. Smart Receipt Analyzer, GPT-powered Chatbot, and Mockup-to-Code tool. Includes clone-ready templates.
