## Part 1: Foundations

> “Before you shape the structure, let the structure shape your thinking.”

---

Before diving into folder names and layouts, we begin where all strong architecture does: with **understanding**. Part 1 is about building a **mental model** for why folder structure matters—not just in technical terms, but in terms of workflow, scalability, and developer sanity.

Too often, folder decisions are treated as cosmetic—"just preferences." But the moment a project grows past 3 features or 2 contributors, structure becomes the **invisible architecture** that either holds your system together or lets it fracture under pressure.

This section lays the groundwork by exploring:

* Why structure is not a personal preference but a team contract
* How bad folder practices lead to bugs, confusion, and duplication
* What modularity and scalability actually mean (and how they differ)
* Which architectural principles give structure lasting power
* How your stack (React + Vite + FastAPI) influences structural decisions

### What You'll Learn in Part 1

| Chapter                                       | Key Idea                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Introduction**                           | Why this book exists, who it’s for, and what it will change in how you build.                         |
| **2. Why Folder Structure Matters**           | From chaotic codebases to mental overhead—real stories of structure gone wrong.                       |
| **3. Modularity vs. Scalability**             | Definitions, trade-offs, and why you need both at different stages.                                   |
| **4. How Structure Impacts Software Quality** | Maintainability, testability, onboarding—structure is the silent driver.                              |
| **5. Core Principles of Architecture**        | The foundational concepts behind great structure: SoC, DRY, cohesion, and more.                       |
| **6. Understanding the Stack**                | The architectural assumptions and constraints of React + FastAPI, and how they shape folder strategy. |

### Why This Section Matters

You don’t just need folders that "make sense."
You need folders that **scale with your product**, **align with your team**, and **stand the test of change**.

By the end of Part 1, you’ll see folder structure not as a rigid decision—but as a **living system** that reflects the philosophy behind your software.

Let’s begin with the problem that sparked this book:
**“Where do I put this file?”**
