## Part 2: Modularity

> “Modularity isn’t about folders. It’s about boundaries, ownership, and change without fear.”

---

In Part 2, we move from *why* structure matters to *how* modularity delivers clarity, flexibility, and velocity—especially in the early and mid-stages of software development.

Whether you're building an OCR-to-GPT receipt analyzer or a chatbot that extracts meaning from legal documents, the principle remains the same:

> **Organize by what changes together. Isolate what changes independently.**

That’s modularity.

You don’t just want to build features—you want to build **self-contained units of value**, each with their own logic, tests, and UI.

This part teaches you how to design for that.

---

### Why Modularity?

A modular folder structure helps you:

* Keep features isolated and independently testable
* Onboard new developers faster with clearer ownership
* Avoid cross-feature bugs and naming collisions
* Grow prototypes into real products without rewrites

It’s ideal for:

* Solo developers or small teams
* MVPs and internal tools
* Projects still shaping their domain boundaries

Modularity is **not** a shortcut—it's a strategy for **maintainable independence**.

### Modularity ≠ Simplicity

Modular apps often **feel simpler** because they reduce inter-feature dependency—but under the hood, they demand thoughtful composition.

This part doesn’t just show you the shape of a modular app.  
It teaches you how to **think modularly**: which boundaries matter, how to organize logic per feature, and how to evolve structure as complexity grows.

---

By the end of Part 2, you’ll be able to:

* Structure both React and FastAPI projects using the **feature-first** philosophy
* Keep services, hooks, routes, and logic **inside each feature**
* Prevent shared-state bleed and keep testability high
* Prepare for the day when modular won’t be enough (spoiler: that’s Part 3)
