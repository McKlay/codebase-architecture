## Part 5: Case Studies and Templates

> “Architecture is not just theory—it’s tested in the trenches.”

---

After all the principles, patterns, and folder diagrams, it’s time to **see structure in motion**.

**Part 5** is where everything comes together—real applications, real constraints, and real decisions.  
You’ll walk through complete project architectures, each grounded in practical needs like OCR pipelines, GPT integration, frontend rendering, RAG workflows, and scalable deployment.

This isn’t just about folder layout.  
It’s about the *why* behind every structural decision:

* Why one feature was split into its own module
* Why a service was abstracted into a core layer
* Why certain logic was centralized vs. colocated

Each case study is annotated, mapped, and paired with downloadable templates to **help you build your own production-grade apps faster**.

### What Makes These Case Studies Special?

Each project:

* Was designed with both **AI workflows** and **scalable architecture** in mind
* Shows how to evolve from **modular → hybrid → scalable**
* Is accompanied by a **starter template**, folder walkthrough, and real-world insights

### What You'll Learn in Part 5

| Chapter                                            | Key Idea                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **19. Case Study: Smart Receipt/Invoice Analyzer** | A modular-first design featuring OCR, GPT parsing, and dynamic frontend rendering. Traces the path to hybrid structure.                                                |
| **20. Case Study: Document Intelligence Chatbot**  | A scalable AI system using embeddings, RAG, streaming, and layered backend services. Highlights clear separation of vector logic, UI, and GPT prompts.                 |
| **21. Case Study: AI-Powered Mockup-to-Code Tool** | A modular + scalable hybrid. Uses image upload, GPT-based UI generation, and structured API/service layers.                                                            |
| **22. Complete Starter Templates**                 | Prebuilt React + FastAPI templates for Modular, Scalable, and Hybrid architectures. Includes folder walkthroughs, README guides, and `npx`-ready cloning instructions. |

### Included Templates

| Template               | Stack                            | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular Starter**    | React + FastAPI                  | Feature-based folder setup, ideal for early-stage apps or MVPs |
| **Scalable Starter**   | React + FastAPI                  | Layered architecture, great for larger apps and multi-team dev |
| **Hybrid AI Template** | React + FastAPI + GPT + pgvector | Real-world GPT + vector DB integration with modular RAG flow   |

### Why This Section Matters

Theory fades when deadlines loom and bugs creep in.

These case studies show how to **scale intentionally**:

* When to refactor and why
* How structure accelerates or hinders growth
* How modularity, scalability, and AI integration coexist in production

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

* Reverse-engineer any folder structure with confidence
* Use ready-made templates to jumpstart your own stack
* Evolve your project based on the same patterns used by AI-native teams
